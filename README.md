Two-Week MVP Plan:
Week 1 (Days 1–7): Core Features, Data Extraction, and Authentication
1. Feature Scoping & Tech Stack Setup (Day 1)
Core Features:
Receipt scanning and data extraction (OCR)
Basic data storage
User authentication (login/signup)
Tech Stack: Finalize your choices (SQL, Tesseract, JAVA/Rails, Firebase/Auth0 for user authentication)
2. Receipt Scanning & Data Extraction (Days 2–3)
OCR Integration:


Integrate an OCR library (e.g., Tesseract or Google Vision API). Prioritize extracting key data like:
Vendor name
Item names
Prices
Quantities
Total price
Make sure this feature works reliably with at least 70-80% of receipts (don’t worry about edge cases yet).

Receipt Upload:


Set up the ability to upload receipt images or take photos directly within the app.
Store images and extracted data in the backend.
3. Data Storage Setup (Day 4)
Database Schema: Set up a simple schema for storing receipt data:
Vendor name, item details (name, price, quantity), total, date.
MySQL for this.
4. User Authentication (Days 5–7)
Authentication Setup:
Use Firebase Authentication or Auth0 to handle user signup/login.
Ensure basic login functionality works (you can always improve UX/UI later).

Week 2 (Days 8–14): Analytics, External Integration, and Polishing for Demo
5. Basic Analytics Dashboard (Days 8–9)
Dashboard Setup:
Build a simple dashboard to display key financial metrics (total sales, total expenses, and profit) based on the receipt data stored in the database.
Chart.js or Recharts for visualization.
6. External Integration (Days 10–11)
Choose One Integration:
For the demo, choose Square (simple API) to integrate sales data.
Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication with Square to pull transaction data.
Merge Square data with the receipt data to show a combined view on the dashboard.

7. Polish the Demo (Days 12–13)
UI/UX Improvements:
Make sure the UI is clean and intuitive, even if basic.
Focus on the core user flows: uploading receipts, viewing analytics, and logging in.
Testing:
Ensure receipt upload and OCR are working smoothly.
Test the integration with Square (external system).
Test the login/signup process.
8. Final Testing & Demo Prep (Day 14)
Bug Fixing:
Ensure that everything works well together. Fix any issues related to UI/UX or core functionality.
Deployment:
Deploy the app to a simple platform like Heroku for quick hosting.
Test on the live version to make sure all features are working before the demo.

Key Adjustments to Fit the Timeline:
Narrow the Scope: Limit the MVP to:


Receipt scanning with basic OCR data extraction (vendor name, items, total).
Simple dashboard showing basic financial metrics (total sales, expenses, and profit).
One external integration (Square is the best option for simplicity).
User authentication (login/signup).
Leave Advanced Features for Later: Future Features like complex AI insights, multiple integrations, or deep financial analysis should be put on hold. 
Use Pre-Built Libraries/Services: Don't reinvent the wheel:


Use Tesseract for OCR.
Use Chart.js or Recharts for the dashboard.
Use Firebase or Auth0 for user authentication.
